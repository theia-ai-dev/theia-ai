As with everything you read (or hear, or see . . .) you should question it. It should encourage you to investigate more of the subject at hand, to look up the references (no references is a bad sign). If nothing else, it can provide a valuable lesson in skepticism and the depth required to truly understand these fields; you didn't really think that such complex topics could be properly addressed in a twenty minute TED talk or a single non-reference book, did you? These things are teasers, meant to whet your appetite or let you know that there is a broader world out there."}

Most apartments also charge a security deposit, generally one month's rent.  Custom in Japan favors the landlord heavily with regards to security deposits, for example in accepting debits against it to return the apartment to pristine condition (such as buying new tatami), so most people wouldn't expect to receive it back either.  e.g. I got charged a $350 \"cleaning fee\" after paying for my own cleaners to make it absolutely sparkle.

At this point they have your master password.\nI understand why they do this: it's convenient and lets you share/give passwords to others. But this feature is 100% incompatible with the claim that they never see your master password.\n###Response: My understanding is that even with their web login process your password isn't sent to their servers in plaintext. From the comments on their heartbleed blog post: \"We only use one-way salted hashes (after going through PBKDF2 rounds) to send to the server for authentication.\"\nSo their servers get a hashed version of your password, but not the password itself.

Everyone - every single person - outside the UAV community does call them drones.

You claim to know all religious are \"man made belief systems\", \"unjustified\", with \"no logical backing\" -- claims that a domain expert can make regarding perhaps a few religions they're intimately familiar with, but not that anyone can actually make for all religions.  How many religions have you studied deeply enough to really be able to make that claim?  If Christianity is on your list, have you ever read the Didache, or De Principiis?

{"text": "Write a response to the following message:\nI would think this leads quickly to another question people might not want to answer... Does empathy increase the probability that the actions you decide to take will reduce or increase suffering?\nI am a fan of an old German saying:  \"Good intentions are the opposite of good actions.\"\nEvery tragedy in human history that I know of was born from good intentions.  Make society stronger, make the majority happier, make people safer, make them healthier, etc.  The bottom line is that good intentions have no influence on the consequences of actions.  To determine what the consequences will be and whether a course of action is likely to help or hurt, we might have to abandon empathy during the discussion.  Of course, we shouldn't ignore empathy when considering whether we want the consequences or not.\n###Response: >Does empathy increase the probability that the actions you decide to take will reduce or increase suffering?\nInteresting question. You are speculating about human psychology based on your understanding of history. Though you haven't cited any literature to back up your statements, and you haven't claimed that you have knowledge of any psychological literature, I still find your opinion valuable.\nI've read some of the literature related to this question. Here is one thing it says: psychopaths are people who almost never feel empathy. They decide to take many actions and many of those actions have disastrous and extremely harmful consequences for those around them. The harm they do is grossly out of proportion compared to the harm committed by non-psychopaths. They are extremely exploitative and cruel and disproportionately commit a large number of crimes.\nPsychopaths are now roughly defined, by researchers, as people who don't experience empathy. If you want to see how people without empathy behave, look no further than the psychopath.\nIt's not pretty, and it contradicts your idea here.\nA psychologist who specializes in psychopathy is Dr. Stout, who wrote several famous books about this topic.\nThe research shows that lack of empathy absolutely and unequivocally leads to hurting others. The actions of those who lack empathy hurt other people in far greater proportion. Operating empathetically involves feeling rather than logical thinking and it requires being in touch with your emotions.\n\"The road to hell\" phrase refers to INTENTIONS, not EMPATHY. Intentions are cognitive, they are analytical. So good intentions may be meaningless (if this proverb has any truth) because good intentions are NOT empathy. What is more important are the FEELINGS of empathy."}

In this case I think you've reduced a complicated situation to a nifty sounding catch phrase that appeals to our libertarian leanings (even mine).\nI used to manage a high-volume retail game store (~3m in yearly sales, $30 at a time). Many gamers literally do spend all of their disposable income on the games, and pirate what they cannot afford (and surprise, huge swaths of the gamer population are poor as dirt, and with the amount of time and money they spend on games this isn't changing). This kind of DRM would exist if 1 person or 1million people were pirating games, because its the only secure solution.\nI don't think this kind of DRM will be successful in improving PC sales in general. The only reason Blizzard gets away with it is because their games will always be at the top of gamer's purchase lists. They are high quality products with a shitload of content and beautiful user interfaces. If every game company followed suite, I don't think the result would be successful.\nedit, and context: I don't really care what Blizzard does to protect their games.

I think this will probably be true for D3, as well.\n###Response: Here's a visualization where your understanding of the world and my understanding of the world converge:\nLet's say the statistical composite gamer buys 10 games a year and consumes 100.  Game companies don't get rewarded for being in the top 100 and they don't get rewarded for having perfect anti-piracy: they get rewarded for being 1 step ahead of #11.\nYou're probably insanely familiar with the importance of the new release window, where the supermajority of game sales (and more importantly to publishers, original sales) are made.

C++ heavy apps on Android are larger, use more memory, and load less quickly. This isn't obvious if you're used to other worlds, but it is a side effect of how pervasive Dalvik is on the system. Even if most of your app code is in C++ it's still easy to get screwed by a GC pause caused by where you have to interface with the framework.\nMuch of the underlying problem here is that speed-wise Dalvik just isn't very good.

But I did spend 4 years writing a significant amount of systems C++ code in VC++, and --- at least 8 years ago --- VC++ was significantly better than any comparable C environment.\nWe can get into a tit-for-tat on it versus, e.g. GCC, but I feel like one way to lose a programming environment shoot-out is to imply that Microsoft half-asses that part of the business.\nRegarding #2, you seem to be sticking up for the author's implication that Ruby has \"complex\" syntax compared to Lisp. Clearly, most languages have more \"idiosyncracies\" (here defined as: \"notation of any sort\") than Lisp. That doesn't make Lisp's austerity an interesting lesson to take to other languages; it is, in fact, the major failure of Lisp.\nThere is a notion, unaddressed in the original post but far more important than any of that post's insights, that obsessively regular syntax is crucial to metaprogramming. Even defined down to \"true macros\", this is simply folk wisdom: you can get \"Lisp-style macros\" out of any language that gives you access to an abstract syntax tree.\nFinally, call the two \"mainstream\" high level languages Ruby  and Python (relegating Perl and PHP to uh, different, uh, categories). Both share the type system the author appreciates in Lisp.\n###Response: Re #3: you're right to distinguish between the MS environments for C++ and C#. Your comment on VC++ matches my experience from about the same time. But when I say that VS.NET is backward and provincial, believe me I mean it as an understatement. There are very clear points of comparison (Eclipse and IntelliJ) and compared to either of them VS is a bad joke. It only survives because the MS development world is largely a parochial backwater in which most programmers eat the porridge they're given and don't care to look at anything else, like medieval peasants who never leave their village.\nApologies for ranting. I've never been a big MS-hater (though I seem to be getting there), and I hardly think the Java IDE is the last word in programming environments (having an editor generate my duplicate code for me is not my idea of a good time; as you may have noticed, I like Lisp!)

I have a problem with any number for that matter.  50 is too low, and any number will always be too low, the way I see it if you incorporate Dawkins' idea of the Selfish Gene into the mix.  I would argue that sticking around \"to ensure the survival of our offspring\" (as you put it) for the human species is significantly more important than any other species on the planet.\nTurtles don't need this survival strategy.  Lay eggs (procreate) and chuck - that form of hormesis aggressively weeds out the weak members of the species from the ones laying eggs for the next generation.  While chimps, elephants and whales may also need to \"stick around longer\" for their young - relatively, the human is by far an incredible outlier in this regard.  Not only do adults have to stick around for their kids well into the young's teen years, but elders too have to stick around for the group or for the clan.  This last point is important to understand the relationship between the survival success of the species and an imagined age cutoff for \"usefulness\" (that contributes to the success of the species) of any one member of the species.  The individual has extended roles beyond just his/her offspring.  His/her role in the clan's survival success mattered too.\nRecent discoveries of hominid fossils suggest that as early as Erectus, \"humans\" have been keeping their elders alive! :-)  Evidence of a toothless skulls suggest that able members of the group may have been keeping the elder alive by chewing for her.

Yes it has a lot of warts, but it has a lot of things that make it nice for web development.\na) try your new code by saving in your editor, and hitting reload in your web browser.\nb) it's very approachable.  People who only know HTML and CSS can be expected to do a little bit of PHP work to integrate their changes.  If you setup the right network mounts, they just need to edit files and reload (see a)\nc) it's not super high overhead at runtime.  If you're not using a framework, and you don't build up a crazy object hierarchy, it's not too hard to get your page out with about 10 ms of overhead beyond data fetching.  For very simple webservices (fetch data, possibly from multiple sources, and do a little formatting for the consumer), I was able to get the overhead down to 2ms.  You can certainly do better with other languages, but you can usually get better throughput improvement by working on getting data quickly. Btw, all the frameworks are terrible; many of them add 100 ms to the page just for the privilege of loading the includes; PHP is a framework for web programming thank you very much.\nd) cleanup; you don't have to worry about it. If you don't do anything weird (c extensions, with non-preferred malloc), at the end of the request, everything is thrown away.\nThat said, there are plenty of things PHP isn't good at: I wouldn't run a long running process in PHP; and multithreaded PHP sounds like a bad idea.\n###Response: Yes, PHP is its own web framework, but it's not a very good one. And, as you say, implementing a better one on top of it adds a lot of overhead due to the execution model. With other languages, where you don't throw everything away at the end of the request, you are free to implement a good web framework without suffering additional overhead.\nAs for a), many (most?) frameworks are able to monitor the source files and reload the application when they change, in order to enable that workflow.

{"text": "Write a response to the following message:\nLol. I just realized why people aren't understanding my other comments about why this debate matters.  Here's an explanation:\nCapital gains on the sale of capital assets (i.e., stock) by foreign persons are not taxable by the U.S.  Only certain types of capital investment (i.e., real property or income that is connected to a U.S. business activity) is taxable by the US.  See generally Section 871 and its accompanying regulations.\nCapital gains by foreign persons are generally taxed by the foreign person's country of residence unless the foreign person has a tax nexus to the U.S. Generally, the tax nexus is provided by citizenship, actual residence, or deemed residence.  Id.\nEduardo is not an actual or deemed resident of the U.S., thus his only tax nexus was via his citizenship.  By renouncing his citizenship, he severs that last bit of tax nexus.\nConsequently, the sale of the Facebook stock is now taxable only by the foreign jursidiction in which he is a citizen/resident.  In this case, Singapore does not impose a capital gains tax, so he would effectively not be subject to any tax at all on the sale of his Facebook stock.\nThis matters because Singapore is one of the few non-tax haven jurisdictions that provides for no capital gain taxation.  It's also unusual that he did so around the same time that Facebook began publicly indicating it would move toward an IPO, despite Eduardo having been eligible for Singaporean citizenship for some time before he actually renounced his U.S. citzenship.  Note also that Eduardo \"resides\" in Singapore but spends significant amounts of time outside of the country.\nThis is why so many people (including myself) think Eduardo renounced his citizenship to avoid paying taxes.  It's the circumstances surrounding his renunciation which are suspicious.  If he'd chosen to move to Europe, or China, or Hong Kong, or some other place, it wouldn't be an issue.  But based on the totality of the circumstances, it looks like tax avoidance was his primary motive.\nHope this helps.\n###Response: > In this case, Singapore does not impose a capital gains tax, so he would effectively not be subject to any tax at all on the sale of his Facebook stock.\nThis is blatantly wrong.\nThe US, since 2008, has an exit tax. For the purposes of US taxation, what happens is that on the day that he loses his US citizenship, US-Eduardo sells all his things to Singapore-Eduardo at fair market price. Thus, he pays capital gain taxes up until that day.\nAfter that day, it is up to the new jurisdiction: Singapore won't tax him for any further gains, most other countries would.\nEither way, if facebook goes down between the day he loses citizenship and the day he actually sells, he has lost money.\nHe's saved some taxes already, but that's a result of a bet. Another way to make the same bet would have been to buy a call option (or sell a put option, or go long a forward or future) on Facebook stock.\nSchumer is just looking for votes and publicity. And the media are happy to distort the story to make villains and heros, because they sell more ads that way."}

{"text": "Write a response to the following message:\nHow to multiply isn't necessarily self evident, especially if you don't have a positional notation system. Even after the introduction of arabic numerals into Europe there were many different algorithms for performing multiplication, some of which are only moderately recognizable as our long multiplication system:\nhttp://www.pballew.net/old_mult.htm\nThis method in practice would have used objects that represent larger numbers(1,5,10) and with those a practitioner only needs to know how to add, subtract and multiply or divide by 2. All of which are operations which can be performed quickly. It certainly isn't true that you would need as many stones as the final result.\n###Response: If you used objects to represent 5, 10, 100 stones, etc., and were capable of e.g. saying that 7 and 7 stones equal one 10-stone and 4 stones, you would have a compact representation of your number, and that would be the proper use of this algorithm.\nBut note that this is different from what John H. Lienhard explicitly says: \"the hole contains 224 stones\". His version is completely pointless. None of us are objecting to the algorithm itself - yes, it is equivalent to long multiplication in binary, it has been known since ancient times, and there is nothing wrong with it. However, Lienhart has a) apparently misunderstood the point of the algorithm, and b) ascribed it to Ethiopian village \"shamans\", which gives one the mental image of Ethiopians standing around and watching a shaman manipulate hundreds of stones, instead of simply counting out the price - 7 for the first goat, 7 for the second, etc. This probably never happened, and would be stupid if it did; and yet people are coming here to defend this as an example of \"Ethiopian ingenuity\".\nWhat kind of \"shamans\" is Ethiopia supposed to have, anyway? Aren't they a Siberian thing? Ethiopia has one of the most ancient Christian traditions in the world, you know.
